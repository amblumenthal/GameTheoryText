      <title>Defining Games</title>

<question>What is a game? Explore your definition. Try to bend it. Try to break it. List at least 3 examples of games and 3 examples of things that are not games (but might be dangerously close) according to your definition.
</question>

<question> Play each of the following games a couple of times to get familiar with the rules. (You can find playing boards for some of the games in the pages below)

    <li> <term>Tic-Tac-Toe</term> (as discussed in class)</li>
    <li> <term>Rock, Paper, Scissors</term> (as discussed in class) </li>

    <li> <term>Hex</term>: Hex is a two-player game played on an <m>11</m> by <m>11</m> board of hexagons. The players have two unique symbols (X and O). They alternate placing their symbols. The X player wins if they create a connected path of X's from the top of the board to the bottom, and the O player wins if they create a connected path of O's from the left to the right. If the board is filled with no such path, the game is a draw. </li>

<question xml:id="SomeGames"> Now that you're familiar with the rules, try to develop a strategy for each game. If BOTH players make ``optimal decisions'' what happens? How can you tell? [It may help to start with smaller versions of the games to get an idea, for example pick-up stones with only 7 or 8 rocks.]

<question> ``Strategy'' is not really something we talked about. What does that mean? How can we formalize it?
