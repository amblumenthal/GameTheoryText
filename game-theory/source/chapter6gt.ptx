<p> We turn our attention to zero sum games to develop some theory. </p>

<definition>[Zero Sum Game Matrix]
A game matrix for a game with two players, Rose and Colin, is a matrix with each row representing a choice that Rose can make and each column representing a choice that Colin can make. 
The <m>(i,j)</m> entry of the matrix is the payout for Rose. (Note then that the payout for Colin is <m>-a</m>.)
</definition>




<question>
<p>
 For each of the following zero-sum games, find all equilibrium pairs. If you are unable to find equilibrium pairs, explain the issue you ran into. Justify your answers.

<p>We now develop another way to find a ``good'' strategy which does not rely on dominating strategies. We think of this new strategy as ``extremely defensive play.''</p>

 Prove the following: 
</p>
<claim>
Let <m>A</m> be a zero-sum game matrix. If iterated deletion of dominated strategies reduces <m>A</m> to a <m>1 \times 1</m> matrix consisting of the entry in position <m>(i,j)</m> of the original matrix, then the <m>(i,j)</m> entry of <m>A</m> is an equilibrium point.

</p>
</question>




<definition>
The <term>expected value</term> of a game of chance is the average net gain or loss that we would expect per game if we played the game many times. We compute the expected value by multiplying the value of each outcome by its probability of occurring and then adding up all of the products.
</definition>

<p>For example, imagine you have a coin that comes up heads <m>1/4</m> of the time and tails <m>3/4</m> of the time. If you gain <m>2</m> dollars for every heads and lose <m>4</m> dollars for every tails, the expected value of the game is <me>(\frac{1}{4}*2) + (\frac{3}{4} * -4) =\frac{1}{2} -3 = -\frac{5}{2} </me></p>

<ul>
  <li> If we roll a fair <m>6</m> sided die and win dollars equal to the number rolled, what is the expected value of the game? </li>
  <li> If we roll two fair <m>6</m> sided dice and win dollars equal to the sum of the rolled numbers, what is the expected value of the game? </li>
</ul>



<p>We now turn our attention to mixed strategies, but need to build tools to deal with them first. Recall that a mixed strategy can be written as follows: <m>[(r_1,r_2,\dots,r_m),(c_1,c_2,\dots,c_m)]</m> where <m>r_i</m> is the probability that Rose selects row <m>i</m> and <m>c_j</m> is the probability that Colin selects column <m>j</m>. </p>

  <statement>
      <term>One-card Stud Poker</term>
      We begin with a deck of cards in which <m>50\%</m> are Aces (you can use Red cards for Aces) and <m>50\%</m> are Kings (you can use Black cards for Kings). There are two players and one dealer. The play begins by each player putting in the ante (1 chip). Each player is dealt one card face down. WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIS OR HER CARD, the players decide to Bet (say, 1 chip) or Fold. Players secretly show the dealer their choice. If one player bet and the other folded, then the player who bet wins. If both bet or both fold, then Ace beats King (or Red beats Black); winner takes the pot (all the chips from the ante and any bets). If there is a tie, they split the pot.

<p>Make the payout plot (the plots we have been making in the past few problems) for Rose in this game. Note there should be <m>3</m> lines on your plot. (Why?) Conjecture an optimal strategy for Rose based on your plot.</p>

<p>In class, we considered the lines drawn in a payoff plot as upper and lower bounds for payouts. They are a sort of worst or best case scenario for each player given a particular strategy. 
We formalize this notion with the following definition:</p>
<definition>
Let <m>\textbf{p}</m> be a strategy for Rose. The <term>guarantee</term> of <m>\textbf{p}</m> in a game <m>A</m> is the \textit{minimum} entry of the vector <m>\textbf{p}A</m> (since Colin will choose the lowest value of these options). Conversely, the <term>guarantee</term> of a strategy <m>\textbf{q}</m> for Colin is the \textit{maximum} entry of the vector <m>A\textbf{q}</m> (since Rose will choose the largest value of these options). 
</definition>

<p>For simplicity's sake, we will stop fighting with Colin's payout vs Rose's payout (though we will keep it in mind for who is winning) and instead calculate only using Rose's payoffs.</p>

<theorem>[Von Neumann's Minimax Theorem]
Every zero sum matrix game <m>A</m> has a unique number <m>v</m>, called the value of <m>A</m> which is the maximum guarantee of a mixed strategy for Rose and the minimum guarantee of a mixed strategy for Colin.

<question>
<p>
 Imagine that Rose and Colin are playing tennis at a high level. Analytics have been done to determine the odds of Rose winning a given point based on the following scenarios. Rose can either hit to Colin's forehand (F) or backhand side (B), and since the ball is moving so quickly, Colin must guess which side, forehand (F) or backhand (B) that Rose will hit to. If Colin guesses wrong, he will not get his racket as solidly on the ball. The data analysts have determined that if both play F, Rose has an <m>20\%</m> chance of winning the point, if the both play B Rose has a <m>50\%</m> chance of winning the point. If Rose plays F and Colin guesses B, she has a <m>80\%</m> chance of winning, and if Rose plays B and Colin guesses F she has a <m>90\%</m> chance of winning.

  <li> What does the payoff vector tell you about which columns Colin should (or shouldn't) play?  </li>
  <li> Determine a strategy for Colin that equates Rose's results. (Hint: There should be a column you never choose from part b.) </li>
  <li> Give a von Neumann solution for this game matrix. </li>
</ol>


<question>
<p>
 Generalize the procedure of the previous problem. Give instructions on how to find a von Neumann solution in any <m>n \times 2</m> zero sum matrix game.

<definition>
  <statement>
      <term>Undercut</term> is a two player game between Rose and Colin. Each round, both players choose a number between <m>1</m> and <m>5</m> and simultaneously reveal their decisions. Let their decisions be <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> with <m>a \leq b</m>.
  </statement>
</definition>
<ul>
  <li> If <m>a+1 = b</m>, then the person who played <m>a</m> adds <m>a+b</m> to their score and the opponent gets nothing. </li>
  <li> Otherwise, each player adds their own number to their score. </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if Rose plays <m>5</m> and Colin plays <m>3</m>, Rose gains <m>5</m> points and Colin gains <m>3</m> for a net difference of <m>+2</m> for Rose. But if Rose plays <m>5</m> and Colin plays <m>4</m>, Rose gets <m>0</m> points and Colin gets <m>9</m> for a net change of <m>-9</m> for Rose!

<question>
<p>
Find a von Neumann solution for Undercut.
(Hint: You will be solving a system of linear equations... those of you who have taken linear algebra may have nice techniques for this!)
